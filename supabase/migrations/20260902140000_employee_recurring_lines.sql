-- Recurring payroll lines per employee (issue #2042).
--
-- A standard Swedish payroll setup is a benefit bike paid via bruttolöneavdrag:
-- the payslip carries the same signed line every month (e.g. "Förmånscykel
-- bruttolöneavdrag -670,17 kr"). employee_benefits only derives positive
-- taxable benefit rows, so recurring deductions had to be re-added by hand on
-- every run: easy to forget and silently wrong (overstated gross, tax, AGA).
--
-- This table mirrors the employee_benefits pattern: an active row inside its
-- validity window is derived into salary_line_items on every calculation,
-- marked with source_recurring_line_id so recalculation replaces derived rows
-- without touching manual ones.

-- Same-company integrity by construction (the dimensions pattern): the
-- composite FK below binds employee_id to the row's company_id, so an
-- RLS-authorized member of one company can never point a recurring line at
-- another company's employee (IDOR guard, CWE-639).
-- Idempotent: #2145 (expense claims) adds the same key, so whichever PR
-- merges second must not collide.
