-- Approval-authority limit per API key: what an agent may finish WITHOUT a human.
--
-- This is deliberately NOT a write limit and deliberately NOT enforced inside
-- commit_journal_entry. Over the ceiling the agent may still stage a
-- pending_operation; it just may not commit it unattended, so a human approves
-- it in /pending. Nothing is destroyed, no voucher number is burned, and no
-- löpnummer gap is created (BFL 5 kap. 7 §).
--
-- ## Why the limit lives on api_keys and never on company_settings
--
-- company_settings.agent_auto_commit_max_amount existed once
-- (20260501120000) and was dropped four days later (20260505190027). A
-- company-scoped money threshold catches HUMANS too, which is the opposite of
-- the intent. Keyed on the credential, the check can only ever fire for an
-- agent: the gate reads actor.type = 'api_key' plus a non-null limit on that
-- key, and human approvals ({type:'user'}), cron, and every cookie-session
-- route commit with a different actor or none at all.
--
-- ## Why validate_and_increment_api_key returns it
--
-- That function is the one place the database itself verifies which credential
-- is acting: it matches the key hash. A limit returned from there is bound to a
-- DB-verified key rather than asserted by the caller. Passing a key id into
-- commit_journal_entry would have been caller-asserted and unverifiable (the
-- pending-op path runs as service_role, where the tenant guard bypasses by
-- design), while costing a DROP+CREATE on the function that issues every
-- voucher number. Two of that function's seven redefinitions were emergency
-- fixes for PostgREST overload ambiguity; there is no upside left to pay that.

-- The single most important line in this migration.

-- A stored 0 would block every commit for that key, and NULL-read-as-0 is the

  'SEK ceiling on what this key may commit without human approval. NULL = no limit, and NULL is the only representation of "no limit": zero is forbidden by CHECK because a stored 0 would block every commit. Over the ceiling the agent still stages the operation for a human to approve.';

-- The body below is copied VERBATIM from 20260621130000_api_keys_rotation_grace.sql
-- (the latest definition, which added previous_key_hash rotation grace) with
-- exactly two changes: unattended_commit_limit joins the RETURNS TABLE, and it
-- is selected into a variable and returned in all three RETURN QUERY branches.
-- Copying an older body would silently revert key rotation and lock out every
-- rotating integration.
