-- P0 security fix: SECURITY DEFINER write RPCs were EXECUTE-able by `anon`.
--
-- State before this migration (verified against production 2026-09-01):
--
--   * Supabase's bootstrap runs
--       ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public
--         GRANT ALL ON FUNCTIONS TO postgres, anon, authenticated, service_role;
--     so every function this repo has ever shipped came out of CREATE with
--     proacl {=X/postgres, postgres=X, anon=X, authenticated=X, service_role=X}.
--     The leading `=X/postgres` is the grant to PUBLIC, and anon is a member of
--     PUBLIC: revoking from anon alone leaves has_function_privilege('anon', ...)
--     TRUE. Every REVOKE below therefore names PUBLIC first. Same trap as
--     20260727120000 (replace_sie_import), which is the precedent for this file.
--
--   * PostgREST exposes every public function as POST /rest/v1/rpc/<name>, and
--     the anon key is public by design, so these eight were unauthenticated
--     cross-tenant primitives:
--
--       sync_team_to_company(uuid,uuid)          INSERTs into company_members,
--                                                the table user_company_ids()
--                                                and every RLS policy read. No
--                                                auth check of any kind.
--       claim_due_webhook_deliveries(int,tstz)   RETURNS every tenant's webhook
--                                                payload bodies and flips the
--                                                rows to in_flight. No auth
--                                                check; p_now is caller-supplied
--                                                so backoff does not limit it.
--       generate_delivery_note_number(uuid)      UPDATEs company_settings for an
--                                                arbitrary company. No auth check.
--       generate_article_number(uuid,uuid)       UPDATEs company_settings and
--                                                articles. No auth check.
--       check_and_increment_inbox_quota(uuid,integer,integer)
--                                                INSERTs and UPDATEs
--                                                inbox_rate_counters for an
--                                                arbitrary company. No auth
--                                                check, so any caller can run
--                                                another tenant's minute and
--                                                day intake quota to the cap
--                                                and stall their receipt
--                                                intake until the window
--                                                rolls.
--       generate_invoice_number(uuid,uuid,text)  UPDATEs company_settings and
--                                                invoices (guard bypassed, below).
--       peek_next_invoice_number(uuid,text)      Leaks another tenant's
--                                                invoice_prefix and next number.
--       get_next_arrival_number(uuid)            Leaks another tenant's
--                                                ankomstnummer series.
--
--   * The last three DID carry a guard, and it did not hold:
--
--       IF auth.uid() IS NOT NULL AND NOT EXISTS (membership) THEN RAISE
--
--     auth.uid() resolves the JWT `sub` claim. The anon key's JWT carries no
--     `sub`, so auth.uid() is NULL for role anon and the guard short-circuits
--     straight into the trusted branch. A NULL-trusted guard is safe ONLY once
--     anon has lost EXECUTE: it is the second layer, never the first, and it
--     was never the reason those functions were safe.
--
-- What this migration does:
--
--   1. Revokes EXECUTE from PUBLIC and anon on all eight, plus from
--      authenticated on the two that have no user-session caller.
--   2. Re-grants EXECUTE to authenticated on the six the app genuinely calls
--      on the user's session client (the five numbering RPCs plus the inbox
--      intake limiter), after replacing the NULL-trusted guard with a
--      fail-closed one, or adding one where there was none (see the guard
--      comment in generate_invoice_number below for the exact trust rule).
--   3. Revokes every grant on public.create_invoice_with_items(jsonb,jsonb),
--      a prod-only leftover that no migration in this repo ever created,
--      nothing calls, and that raises 23502 on every call anyway. It is
--      revoked rather than dropped: see section 3.
--   4. Sweeps the rest: every remaining SECURITY DEFINER, non-trigger function
--      in public whose body writes loses EXECUTE from PUBLIC and anon.
--      authenticated and service_role keep the explicit grants they already
--      hold (verified: all 20 anon-callable definer writers carry an explicit
--      `authenticated=X` entry, so revoking PUBLIC takes nothing away from a
--      signed-in caller). The sweep is what stops this class from recurring on
--      the next function that ships, and it is the same predicate
--      tests/pg/definer-function-grants.pg.test.ts asserts on.
--
-- service_role keeps EXECUTE throughout: the API-key, MCP and cron paths run on
-- createServiceClientNoCookies(), and pg_cron runs as postgres.
--
-- Callers verified by grep before revoking (repo at 5f81c0638):
--   * sync_team_to_company: no TypeScript caller at all. The only callers are
--     create_company_with_owner, create_company_for_user and
--     create_company_for_brand_signup, all SECURITY DEFINER owned by postgres,
--     so the nested EXECUTE check passes as the owner. No re-grant.
--   * claim_due_webhook_deliveries: lib/webhooks/dispatcher.ts is the sole
--     caller, reached only from app/api/webhooks/dispatch/cron/route.ts and
--     lib/webhooks/dispatch-kick.ts, both on createServiceClientNoCookies().
--     No re-grant.
--   * generate_invoice_number: lib/invoices/ensure-invoice-number.ts, on the
--     route's session client (app/api/invoices/route.ts and the finalize/send/
--     convert/mark-sent routes). Re-granted.
--   * peek_next_invoice_number: app/api/invoices/next-number/route.ts, session
--     client. Re-granted.
--   * get_next_arrival_number: app/api/supplier-invoices/route.ts, the credit
--     routes, lib/pending-operations/commit.ts and the invoice-inbox extension;
--     session client on the app routes, service client on the /api/v1 and MCP
--     paths. Re-granted.
--   * generate_delivery_note_number: app/api/invoices/route.ts (session client)
--     and app/api/v1/companies/[companyId]/invoices/route.ts (service client).
--     Re-granted.
--   * generate_article_number: lib/articles/ensure-article-number.ts, from
--     app/api/articles/route.ts, app/api/import/articles/execute/route.ts and
--     lib/pending-operations/commit.ts. Re-granted.
--   * check_and_increment_inbox_quota: lib/rate-limits/inbox.ts, called from
--     extensions/general/invoice-inbox/index.ts on the user's session client
--     (ctx.supabase) at /upload, /upload/create, /items/:id/extracted-data,
--     /items/:id/retry-extraction, /inbox/domain and /inbox/domain/verify, and
--     on a service-role client at /inbound (createServiceRoleClient built with
--     SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY); whatsapp-inbox's lib/process-inbound.ts
--     forwards the createServiceClientNoCookies() client its webhook-kick and
--     sweep callers create. Both shapes are live, so this one keeps
--     authenticated EXECUTE and gets the in-body guard rather than a blanket
--     revoke. Re-granted. The TypeScript helper fails open on RPC error, so a
--     refusal degrades to "this request was not counted", never a 500 for a
--     real user; the cross-tenant write is what the guard stops.
--
-- Not touched on purpose: public._backfill_remaining_20260817. It is 337 rows
-- of pre-backfill invoice remaining/paid/deduction state, i.e. financial
-- rollback data, already locked down by 20260825170000. Dropping it is a
-- separate founder decision, not part of a security revoke.
--
-- pg-test: tests/pg/definer-function-grants.pg.test.ts

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 1. No user-session caller: revoke outright, service_role only.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

REVOKE EXECUTE ON FUNCTION public.sync_team_to_company(uuid, uuid)
  FROM PUBLIC, anon, authenticated;
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION public.sync_team_to_company(uuid, uuid) TO service_role;

COMMENT ON FUNCTION public.sync_team_to_company(uuid, uuid) IS
  'Copies team_members into company_members for a newly created company. Has no authorization check of its own, so it is callable only from the SECURITY DEFINER company-creation RPCs (which do check) and from service_role. Not callable by anon or authenticated.';

REVOKE EXECUTE ON FUNCTION public.claim_due_webhook_deliveries(integer, timestamptz)
  FROM PUBLIC, anon, authenticated;
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION public.claim_due_webhook_deliveries(integer, timestamptz) TO service_role;

COMMENT ON FUNCTION public.claim_due_webhook_deliveries(integer, timestamptz) IS
  'Claims due automation_webhooks deliveries across all tenants for the cron sender (FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED). Returns raw payload bodies, so it is service_role only. Not callable by anon or authenticated.';

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 2. The six RPCs the app calls on the user's session client: the five
--    numbering ones and the inbox intake limiter.
--    Fail-closed guard first, then least-privilege grants.
--
--    Bodies below are the production definitions verbatim (pg_get_functiondef,
--    2026-09-01) with the guard block replaced or added. search_path is
--    restated per function because CREATE OR REPLACE drops every setting
--    attached via ALTER FUNCTION ... SET, and peek_next_invoice_number restates
--    STABLE for the same reason.

-- 3. Lock down public.create_invoice_with_items(jsonb, jsonb): dead on arrival.
--
--    Prod-only leftover. No migration in this repo ever created it (see the
--    note at 20260304191528_set_search_path_on_functions.sql:9), and nothing
--    reaches it: no TypeScript caller, and no other function body, view,
--    policy, column default or pg_depend entry references it (read-only sweep
--    of pg_proc.prosrc, pg_views, pg_policies, information_schema.columns and
--    pg_depend, 2026-09-01). pg_stat_statements has no record of a call since
--    its last reset.
--
--    It is also non-functional, and has been since the multi-tenant refactor:
--    it INSERTs into public.invoices without company_id, which is NOT NULL, so
--    every call raises 23502 before a row is written.
--
--    We REVOKE rather than DROP. The revoke closes the security hole in full
--    (it is the same treatment section 4 gives every other definer writer),
--    and a DROP would be an irreversible schema deletion against production
--    for a function that is already inert. Removing it is cleanup, not
--    security, so it is left as a separate decision. If that decision is
--    taken, the DROP belongs in its own migration where it can be reviewed
--    and reverted on its own terms.

-- 4. Sweep every other SECURITY DEFINER writer in public.
--
--    These are functions with legitimate authenticated or service_role callers
--    (create_company_with_owner, delete_last_voucher, seed_chart_of_accounts,
--    validate_and_increment_api_key, ...). None of them has an anon-key call
--    path: every call site resolves either the user's session client or
--    createServiceClientNoCookies(). They lose PUBLIC and anon only; the
--    explicit authenticated and service_role grants they already carry are
--    untouched, so no application path changes.
--
--    Done as a loop rather than a hand list because a hand list is exactly how
--    the three guarded numbering RPCs were wrongly declared safe. The predicate
--    is duplicated in tests/pg/definer-function-grants.pg.test.ts, which fails
--    CI when a future migration ships another anon-callable definer writer.
