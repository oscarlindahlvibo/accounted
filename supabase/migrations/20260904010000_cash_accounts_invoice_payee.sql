-- Named invoice payee accounts.
--
-- Until now a company had exactly one set of payment instructions per invoice
-- currency (company_settings.invoice_payment_accounts, keyed SEK/EUR/...), and
-- the invoice picked them by currency alone. A company with two SEK bank
-- accounts, or two bankgiro numbers, had nowhere to put the second one.
--
-- cash_accounts is already the per-company bank-account entity (name, IBAN,
-- currency, ledger account, primary flag). This migration makes it the single
-- source for what a customer pays to:
--
--   1. Payee columns on cash_accounts (bankgiro, plusgiro, clearing + account,
--      payee IBAN, BIC, Swish, foreign routing) plus invoice_payee: "may be
--      printed on an invoice". The payee IBAN is its own column: cash_accounts.iban
--      is the bank's identity of the account (written by every PSD2 sync and
--      used to re-pair accounts on reconnect), while payee_iban is what the
--      company chooses to print; a sync must never rewrite an invoice
--      instruction, and a cleared payee IBAN must stay cleared.
--      bg_pg (one text for both giro kinds) was never read or written anywhere
--      and is dropped; verified NULL on every prod and staging row 2026-09-03.
--   2. invoice_payee_defaults: which cash account an invoice in a given
--      currency prints when the invoice itself does not choose. One account
--      may be the default for several currencies: a SEK account with an IBAN
--      is the normal EUR payee, so "default for EUR must be an EUR account"
--      would be wrong.
--   3. A mirror: whenever a default account or its payee fields change, the
--      old company_settings.invoice_payment_accounts map and the legacy SEK
--      columns are rewritten from it. Every existing reader (PDF, email,
--      reminders, Peppol, v1 settings, MCP) keeps working unchanged, and the
--      three writers that only touched the legacy columns can no longer
--      drift from what the PDF prints.
--   4. Payee columns are admin-only at the database, not just in the routes:
--      cash_accounts writes are member-level (bank sync touches them), but
--      where customers are told to pay was admin-only before this migration
--      (company_settings RLS) and must stay so. Revoking an account as payee
--      (invoice_payee = false, admin-only) drops its defaults. Disabling an
--      account (enabled = false, member-level: the bank picker's "Synkas ej")
--      does not: a member must not be able to undo an admin's payee choice;
--      the pick lists exclude disabled accounts and the send gate refuses an
--      invoice that chose one.
--   5. Backfill from today's map onto existing cash accounts, copying each
--      currency entry verbatim (the map entry wins over anything the account
--      knew, including the IBAN): every invoice keeps printing exactly what
--      it printed before. No rows are created: an entry with no matching
--      account stays in the map as the fallback the resolver already honours.
--      Companies that are a migration-reset source (company_migration_resets)
--      are skipped: their rows are immutable by trigger, and the first attempt
--      (as 20260903150000) failed on prod when the mirror wrote one of them.
--      Their legacy map stays in company_settings, which the resolver reads.
--
-- The mirror runs SECURITY DEFINER because company_settings updates are
-- admin-gated by RLS. The admin guard in (4) is what makes that safe: only an
-- admin (or the service role) can change what the mirror derives from.
