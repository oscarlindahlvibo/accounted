-- WooCommerce activation gate: an ACTIVE connection requires BOTH the
-- store-verified credentials (server-to-server wc-auth callback) AND the
-- initiating user's browser confirmation (the return leg, session-bound).
--
-- Before this, the callback alone flipped a row to active: a connection could
-- go live headless, with nobody's session involved, and an abandoned handshake
-- stayed active (feed on) forever. browser_confirmed_at records the session-
-- bound confirmation of the initiating user. The CHECK makes "active implies
-- stored keys and a recorded confirmation" a database invariant instead of an
-- application promise: staged credentials live on PENDING rows, and every
-- consumer selects status = 'active'.
--
-- Scope: this does not authenticate the person who approved in the store.
-- wc-auth delivers keys server-to-server and its redirect carries nothing
-- that identifies the approver, so a store admin who approves a link the
-- initiator generated still connects their store to the initiator's company.
-- The column is member-writable through RLS like the rest of the row; it is a
-- completion record, not a trust boundary.
