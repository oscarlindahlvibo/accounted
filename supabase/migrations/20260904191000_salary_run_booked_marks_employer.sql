-- A booked salary run is evidence that the company pays salaries (support
-- case 2026-09-04: the assistant told a payroll-running aktiebolag in every
-- answer that it "betalar inte löner").
--
-- company_settings.pays_salaries is NOT NULL DEFAULT false and its only
-- writer is the Skatt settings form, so for every company that never opened
-- that form the flag reads false regardless of what the ledger says, while
-- the app itself books the salary verifikat. The flag feeds the assistant's
-- profile block, the composer, the MCP company resource, the Personal menu
-- for enskild firma and (as the fallback for employer_registered) the AGI
-- deadline reminders, so the stale default is visible in five places.
--
-- 20260717151000 already treated in-app payroll as employer evidence once,
-- as a one-off backfill of employer_registered from salary_runs. This makes
-- the same rule continuous and extends it to pays_salaries, at the one place
-- every writer (dashboard, MCP executor, v1 API, seeders) passes through:
-- the run flipping to 'booked'.
--
-- employer_registered is only filled when NULL (never attested): an explicit
-- false is the user's own answer and stays theirs. SECURITY DEFINER because
-- company_settings_update requires company admin, while any member with
-- write access can book payroll; the function touches only the booking
-- company's own row, and Postgres refuses to call a trigger function
-- directly, so it is not reachable through the API.
