/**
 * Builds the journal-entry lines for the clearing entry that closes (fully or
 * partially) a supplier invoice against an actual bank transaction under
 * faktureringsmetoden (accrual): Dr 2440 / Cr <payment account>.
 *
 * Shared between:
 *   - GET /api/transactions/[id]/match-supplier-invoice/preview (read-only,
 *     drives the dialog the user confirms against)
 *   - POST /api/transactions/[id]/match-supplier-invoice (the commit path)
 *
 * Single source of truth so the preview and the committed verifikat are
 * byte-identical: including the payment account and the per-line descriptions,
 * which previously drifted (the preview used `last_supplier_payment_account` and
 * "Kvittning leverantörsskuld" / "Utbetalning från bank", while the commit path
 * defaulted to 1930 and "Utbetalning leverantörsfaktura …").
 *
 * # Öresavrundning (3740)
 *
 * A whole-krona Bankgiro/Swish settlement of an öre-bearing invoice total leaves
 * a sub-krona residual (e.g. paying 11 231,25 with a rounded 11 231,00). Rather
 * than strand that 0,25 kr as a permanent partial, the difference is booked to
 * BAS 3740 (Öres- och kronutjämning) and 2440 is cleared in full so the invoice
 * reaches `paid`. The residual sign drives the 3740 side:
 *
 *   bank paid LESS than owed (apSek > bankSek)  → öresavrundningsvinst → Cr 3740
 *   bank paid MORE than owed (apSek < bankSek)  → öresavrundningsförlust → Dr 3740
 *
 * This polarity is the mirror of the customer side (`buildInvoicePaymentClearingLines`,
 * where AR is cleared with a credit and 3740 takes the opposite side).
 *
 * # SEK only
 *
 * `apSek`/`bankSek` are home-currency (SEK). Cross-currency settlement carries a
 * kursvinst/kursförlust (3960/7960) handled by `createSupplierInvoicePaymentEntry`,
 * not here: öresavrundning is the residual AFTER FX and only meaningful in whole
 * SEK kronor, so callers route only same-currency SEK payments through this helper.
 *
 * # One residual rule for both methods
 *
 * `supplierOreResidual` + `supplierOreRoundingLine` are the only place the
 * supplier side decides "is this an öresavrundning, and which side of 3740".
 * The accrual clearing builder below and the kontantmetoden builder
 * (`buildSupplierInvoiceCashLines`, via `resolveSupplierCashSettlement`) both
 * go through them, so the two methods cannot drift apart again (#2852: the
 * cash path credited the exact öre while the user paid whole kronor).
