/**
 * Billing status for the client-rendered billing section (Settings →
 * Abonnemang, a client component). Returns whether the
 * company is paying, whether Stripe checkout is configured, and the trial expiry
 * (for the days-left urgency banner). Read-only.
 *
 * "Paid" is defined once, in getCompanyEntitlements: this route only relays
 * its answer. `coverage` says how the company is covered (subscription, team,
 * agreement), so a company paying by invoice or on a comp grant gets an
 * "Ingår i ditt avtal" state instead of the upgrade pitch. `isPaying` stays
 * for compatibility and means a Stripe subscription (the manage view).
 *
 * WL-10: a non-paying company covered by its byrå team's agreement (active
 * team-scoped manual grant) additionally gets `teamAgreement: { teamName }`,
 * which the settings surface renders as "Ingår i <byråns namn>s avtal"
 * instead of the upgrade pitch. Additive field: absent for everyone else.
