# Accounted self-host backup: logical database dump + document storage, shipped
# to an S3-compatible bucket, optionally under S3 Object Lock (WORM).
#
# Self-hosted Supabase has no managed backups or PITR, and Swedish bookkeeping
# law (BFL 7 kap) requires the ledger and its underlag (receipts, invoices) to
# be kept for seven years after the end of the fiscal year. This script is the
# minimum that satisfies both: one restorable dump per run, and the documents
# bucket alongside it, on storage the operator controls. See
# docs/SOVEREIGN.md ("Backup and restore") for the runbook and the cron line.
#
# Requirements on the host running it: bash, pg_dump and psql (matching the
# server's major version), tar, gzip, sha256sum (or shasum), AWS CLI v2 (works
# against any S3-compatible endpoint: Safespring, GleSYS, Elastx via
# --endpoint-url).
#
# Environment (required unless marked optional):
#   BACKUP_DATABASE_URL      postgresql://postgres:<password>@<host>:<port>/postgres
#                            Use the Supabase session-mode pooler port or the
#                            db container's port; never a public address.
#   BACKUP_S3_ENDPOINT       e.g. https://s3.sto2.safedc.net
#   BACKUP_S3_BUCKET         bucket name (create it with Object Lock enabled:
#                            Object Lock can only be turned on at creation)
#   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID / AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY   credentials for that bucket
#   BACKUP_S3_REGION         optional, default us-east-1 (what most S3-compatible
#                            endpoints expect for SigV4; Elastx requires it)
#   BACKUP_S3_PREFIX         optional, default "accounted"
#   BACKUP_STORAGE_DIR       optional: path of the Supabase storage volume
#                            (STORAGE_BACKEND=file: <supabase-dir>/volumes/storage).
#                            Omit when storage-api writes straight to S3; then
#                            back that bucket up bucket-to-bucket instead.
#   BACKUP_DB_CONFIG_VOLUME  optional: name of the Supabase `db-config` Docker
#                            volume (e.g. supabase_db-config). It holds the
#                            pgsodium root key; a dump restored without it
#                            cannot decrypt Vault secrets. Requires docker.
#   BACKUP_OBJECT_LOCK_DAYS  optional: when set, every uploaded object gets
#                            COMPLIANCE-mode retention for this many days
#                            (immutable even for the bucket owner). Suggested:
#                            a long value (>= 2600, seven years plus margin)
#                            for the yearly post-bokslut run, a short one for
#                            nightly runs, or unset and rely on bucket default
#                            retention. COMPLIANCE retention cannot be shortened.
#   BACKUP_WORKDIR           optional: scratch directory, default mktemp.
#   BACKUP_LABEL             optional: name fragment, default "nightly".
#   BACKUP_QUIESCE_CMD       optional: a command run BEFORE the dump and
#   BACKUP_RESUME_CMD          AFTER the upload (also on failure), e.g.
#                            "docker compose -f /opt/accounted/docker-compose.yml stop app cron"
#                            and the matching "start". The database dump and
#                            the storage tar are taken one after the other;
#                            an upload landing between them leaves a document
#                            row without its file (or the reverse) in that
#                            set. Stopping the app for the window makes the
#                            set consistent; recommended for the yearly
#                            archive run, optional for nightly runs where the
#                            next night's set covers the gap. Set both or
#                            neither: one without the other is refused
#                            before anything runs.
#
# Prints a short progress log on stdout; exit status is non-zero on any
# failure, which is what a cron wrapper should alert on.

# 1. Database: custom-format dump (compressed, selective restore possible).
#    --no-owner so it restores into a fresh Supabase stack whose roles were
#    created by that stack, not by us. ACLs (GRANT/REVOKE) are kept (no
#    --no-privileges): the migrations lock SECURITY DEFINER RPCs away from
#    anon/authenticated, and the dump is the only record of that. Keeping them
#    is necessary but not sufficient: pg_dump writes ACLs as a diff against
#    PostgreSQL's built-in defaults, so a role-specific "REVOKE ... FROM anon"
#    is not in the dump at all, and a Supabase target's ALTER DEFAULT
#    PRIVILEGES would hand anon/authenticated EXECUTE back to every restored
#    function. restore.sh neutralizes those default privileges before
