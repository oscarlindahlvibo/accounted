# Accounted plugin for Claude Code

The official plugin for [Accounted](https://app.accounted.se), the open-source Swedish bookkeeping platform. Installing it gives Claude two things at once:

1. **The connection**: the Accounted MCP server (150+ bookkeeping tools, resources, and loadable skills) via OAuth. No API key needed.
2. **The flows**: seven short workflow skills that follow the Swedish bookkeeping rhythm. Each one grounds itself in your company's live data, loads the product's Swedish accounting knowledge when it needs it, and stages every write for your approval. Nothing is ever booked without you saying yes.

## Install

```text
/plugin marketplace add erp-mafia/accounted
/plugin install accounted@accounted
```

Then run `/accounted:setup`. It connects the Accounted connector (`/mcp` → authenticate; no account yet? create it on that sign-in screen, with BankID or e-mail), and for a brand-new account it sets up the company right here in the conversation (company form, organisationsnummer, VAT, fiscal year), then hands you the bank and Skatteverket connect links. After that, `/accounted:start` orients you in the books.

## Skills

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/accounted:setup` | First run: connect (create the account if needed) and set up the company from the conversation |
| `/accounted:start` | Connect, orient, and surface what needs attention |
| `/accounted:bookkeep` | Clear unbooked bank transactions and receipts (daily) |
| `/accounted:check` | Read-only health check with a prioritized fix list |
| `/accounted:month-close` | Close the month against the product's checklist |
| `/accounted:vat` | Prepare and reconcile the momsdeklaration |
| `/accounted:payroll` | Monthly salary run and AGI underlag |
| `/accounted:year-end` | Bokslut, readiness-gated |

The skills are deliberately thin: the deep procedural and regulatory content (month-end checklist, VAT rutor, payroll rules, bokslut law) lives server-side in Accounted and is loaded at need via `accounted_load_skill`, so it is always in sync with the product and tailored to your company. `accounted_list_skills` shows everything available.

## How writes work

Every write tool in Accounted stages a **pending operation** with a preview instead of booking directly. Claude shows you the preview; only `accounted_approve_pending_operation`, after your explicit approval, books it. Period locks and Swedish accounting law (immutable vouchers, balanced entries, sequential voucher numbers) are enforced by the product itself.

## Self-hosted

Point the MCP connection at your own instance instead: remove the bundled server and add your own with `claude mcp add --transport http accounted "https://your-host/api/extensions/ext/mcp-server/mcp?tool_namespace=accounted"`, or use the [`accounted-mcp`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/accounted-mcp) stdio bridge with your existing Accounted API key.
